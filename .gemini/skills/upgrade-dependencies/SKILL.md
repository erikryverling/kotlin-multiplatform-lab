- Fix any compilation errors
- Verify the changes by doing the following:
  - Staring the Pixel_9_Pro_API_36 Android emulator
  - Building the app with ./gradlew assembleDebug
  - Installing the build APK with adb install 
  - Verify the app is running and doesn't crash 
  - Start a iPhone 17 Pro simulator 
  - Install the iOS app on the simulator 
  - Verify that it starts
- Summerize all changes in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties and let me approve them
