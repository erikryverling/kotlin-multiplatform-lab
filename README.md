# Kotlin Mutiplatform Lab

This is where I play around and learn Kotlin Multiplatform development

## Running

### Android
You need to create a `local.properties` file with a key named `openWeatherMapApiKey` that contains an API key for [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org)

### iOS
You need to create a `Secrets.plist` file in `iosApp/iosApp` with a key named `openWeatherMapApiKey` that contains an API key for [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org)
