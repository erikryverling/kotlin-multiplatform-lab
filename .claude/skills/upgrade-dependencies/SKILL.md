## Finding Latest Versions

### For Gradle and Gradle Plugins
- Use https://gradle.org/releases/ for Gradle version updates
- Use https://plugins.gradle.org for Gradle plugin versions
- Check plugin-specific GitHub releases pages for the most accurate version information

### For Maven/Android Dependencies
1. **Primary Method - Use WebFetch for Official Sources First**:
    - **BEST PRACTICE**: Use WebFetch to directly fetch official release pages - this is more reliable than web search for very recent releases
    - AndroidX: `WebFetch https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/[library-name]`
    - Compose Multiplatform: `WebFetch https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/releases`
    - Kotlin: `WebFetch https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases`
    - **Fallback**: Use WebSearch with specific queries if official source isn't clear:
        - Format: `"group:artifact" "version" latest maven 2026`
        - Example: `"androidx.navigation:navigation-compose" "2.9.7" OR "2.9.8" latest 2026`
        - Example: `"io.kotest:kotest-assertions-core" "6.0" OR "6.1" latest version`

2. **Check for Patch Releases**: Don't miss intermediate versions!
    - Search for "latest" may skip patch releases (e.g., finding 4.34.0 but missing 4.33.5)
    - For each dependency, search for versions between current and "latest"
    - Patch releases (x.x.X) often contain important bug fixes
    - Example: If current is 1.5.5 and latest is 1.6.0-alpha, check if 1.5.6 exists

3. **Verify Version Exists in Maven Central**:
    - **CRITICAL**: Documentation may mention versions not yet published to Maven
    - Always verify the version resolves during build, not just in documentation
    - If build fails with "plugin not found" or "artifact not found", the version isn't actually available yet
    - Example: AGP 9.x is documented but not in Maven Central as of Feb 2026

4. **Check Official Sources**:
    - AndroidX libraries: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/
    - Kotlin libraries: https://github.com/Kotlin/[library-name]/releases
    - Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android
    - Maven Central directly: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/[group]/[artifact]
    - For each dependency group, search for their official release pages

4. **Version Compatibility**:
    - For Kotlin ecosystem libraries (KSP, kotlinx.serialization, etc.), check compatibility with the Kotlin version
    - Example: KSP version format is `kotlin-version-ksp-version` (e.g., `2.2.21-2.0.5`)
    - Some libraries like kotlinx-serialization have different versions for different Kotlin versions

5. **Special Cases**:
    - kotlin-dsl-plugin: Must match Gradle version requirements (check Gradle warnings)
    - Hilt: Check GitHub issues for Kotlin metadata compatibility
        - **WARNING**: Hilt 2.59+ requires AGP 9.0+, which may not be available yet
        - Version dependencies: Hilt 2.57.2 (Kotlin ≤2.2.x), Hilt 2.58 (Kotlin 2.3.x), Hilt 2.59+ (AGP 9.0+)
    - Android Gradle Plugin (AGP):
        - **WARNING**: AGP 9.x is documented but not published to Maven Central as of Feb 2026
        - Always verify with actual build, not just documentation
        - If unavailable, stay on latest 8.x (e.g., 8.13.1)
    - Coil 3.x: Uses different Maven coordinates (io.coil-kt.coil3 vs io.coil-kt)

## Upgrade Process

1. Analyze libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties
2. For EACH dependency, search for the latest version using the methods above
    - Check for "latest" major/minor version
    - **Also check for patch releases** between current and latest (e.g., if current is 1.5.5, check if 1.5.6, 1.5.7, etc. exist)
3. Upgrade all dependencies in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties
4. Always prefer stable versions over alpha/beta when possible
5. **Document version constraints**: Add comments explaining why certain versions cannot be upgraded
    - Example: `hilt = "2.58" # 2.59+ requires AGP 9.0+, which is not yet available`
    - Example: `android-plugin = "8.13.1" # AGP 9.x documented but not published to Maven`
6. Fix any compilation errors that arise from upgrades
7. If a documented version fails to resolve, it's not actually available yet - stay on previous version and document why

## Verification Steps

Verify the changes by doing the following in order:
1. Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` to check compilation
2. Run `./gradlew test` to run tests (may have issues but compilation is key)
3. Start the Pixel_9_Pro_API_36 Android emulator
4. Install the Android app on the emulator
5. Verify that it starts
6. Start a iPhone 17 Pro simulator
7. Install the iOS app on the simulator
8. Verify that it starts

## Final Steps

1. Summarize ALL changes in libs.versions.toml and gradle-wrapper.properties in a clear table format
2. Present to user for approval - do not proceed without approval
3. When approved, create a commit for the changes named "Bump dependencies"
4. Push the changes to remote

## Common Pitfalls & Lessons Learned

### Missing Patch Releases
**Problem**: Searching for "latest" versions (e.g., "protobuf latest 2026") often returns major/minor releases but skips intermediate patch releases.
- **Example**: Found protobuf 4.34.0-RC1 but missed 4.33.5
- **Example**: Found wear-compose 1.6.0-alpha09 but missed 1.5.6
- **Solution**: Explicitly search for patch versions between current and "latest" (e.g., if on 4.33.1, check 4.33.2, 4.33.3, etc.)

### Documentation vs. Availability
**Problem**: Official documentation may reference versions not yet published to Maven Central.
- **Example**: AGP 9.0.0 is documented on Android Developers site but builds fail with "plugin not found"
- **Example**: Hilt 2.59.1 exists in documentation but requires unpublished AGP 9.0+
- **Solution**: Always verify with actual build. If it fails to resolve, document the constraint and stay on previous version.

### Dependency Chains
**Problem**: Some dependencies require specific versions of other dependencies.
- **Example**: Hilt 2.59+ requires AGP 9.0+, creating a blocked upgrade path
- **Solution**: Document these chains in comments so future upgrades can address them together

### Version Compatibility Testing
**Problem**: Assuming compatibility between versions without testing.
- **Solution**: Always run full build and test suite, even for "minor" upgrades. Patch releases can introduce subtle breaking changes.

### Emulator Storage Issues
**Problem**: Android emulators can fill up storage, preventing app installation during verification.
- **Solution**: Use `emulator -wipe-data` flag to start with fresh storage, or run `adb shell pm trim-caches 1G` to free space

### Same-Day and Very Recent Releases
**Problem**: Versions released on the same day or within 24-48 hours may not appear in initial web searches.
- **Example (Feb 11, 2026 session)**:
    - compose-tooling 1.10.3 was released on Feb 11, 2026 (the day of upgrade) and was initially missed
    - compose-plugin 1.10.1 was released on Feb 10, 2026 (one day before) and was also missed
- **Root Cause**: Web search results take time to index; search engines may not have the very latest information yet
- **Solution**:
    - Use WebFetch to directly fetch official release pages (GitHub releases, developer.android.com) instead of relying solely on web search
    - Example: `WebFetch https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/releases` for Compose Multiplatform
    - Example: `WebFetch https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui` for AndroidX Compose
    - Always check official sources as a final verification step before presenting to user
    - If user asks "why didn't you upgrade to X?", it's likely a very recent release - immediately fetch official sources to verify

### User Notification Requirements
**Problem**: Forgot to use terminal-notifier when waiting for user approval, causing delayed user awareness.
- **Context**: User's CLAUDE.md specifies that terminal-notifier must be used when attention is required
- **Solution**:
    - Always run `terminal-notifier -title "Claude Code" -message "..."` when:
        - Presenting results that need approval (e.g., dependency summary before verification)
        - Waiting for user input or decision
        - Completion of long-running tasks
    - Example: `terminal-notifier -title "Claude Code" -message "Dependency upgrade analysis complete - awaiting your approval"`

### iOS Project Structure
**Problem**: Initial confusion about iOS project location caused build failures.
- **Issue**: Attempted to run xcodebuild from wrong directory
- **Finding**: The .xcodeproj file is located inside the iosApp directory (`/iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj`), not at project root
- **Solution**: Always verify project structure with `find . -name "*.xcodeproj"` before attempting iOS builds

### iOS Build Asset Catalog Issues
**Problem**: Initial iOS build failed with "CompileAssetCatalogVariant" error.
- **Error**: `Command CompileAssetCatalogVariant failed with a nonzero exit code`
- **Solution**: Clean build resolved the issue: `xcodebuild -project iosApp.xcodeproj -scheme iOS -configuration Debug clean build`
- **Lesson**: Asset catalog compilation issues can often be resolved with a clean build

### Successful Major Version Updates (Feb 11, 2026)
**Confirmed Working Upgrades**:
- **Kotlin 2.2.21 → 2.3.10**: No compatibility issues, all tests passed
- **Gradle 9.2.1 → 9.3.1**: Smooth upgrade, minor warnings about kotlin-dsl plugin version mismatch (expected)
- **AGP 8.13.1 → 8.13.2**: Successfully built, AGP 9.0.0 skipped (documented but cautious approach for major versions)
- **Ktor 3.3.3 → 3.4.0**: No issues
- **Compose BOM 2025.11.01 → 2026.01.01**: Includes Compose UI 1.10.3 (same-day release), all tests passed
- **SKIE 0.10.8 → 0.10.10**: Swift interop improvements, no issues
- **Note**: Always document why major versions are skipped (e.g., AGP 9.0.0) to help future upgrades
